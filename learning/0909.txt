used when referring to IO related systems
	- blocking : it will not return until there is activity
			In most cases, processes spend much of their time waiting for something else
		synchronous :
	- non-blocking : system calls will return immediately if there is nothing pending
			it is able to have multiple requests in progress at the same time by the same process(thread).
			A single process is able to handle multiple concurrent requests by interleaving non-blocking IO calls for all the requests
		asynchronous : from client side, receive a callback when the data has been recevied -> let brower continue to work as normal while the request is being handled

	white box test :	1) statement coverage (check code level errors)
						2) dicision coverage (branch test)
						3) condition coverage
	black box test :	1) syntax testing (input as valid value or invalid values)
						2) equivalent partitioning
						3) boundary testing
						4) decision table
	*Path coverage : test different possible paths of method triggeration
